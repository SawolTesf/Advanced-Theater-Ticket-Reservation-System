# Advanced Theater Ticket Reservation System

Welcome to the Advanced Theater Ticket Reservation System! This project is an enhanced version of a previous ticket reservation system, now incorporating a more dynamic solution with linked lists.

## Project Description

The Advanced Theater Ticket Reservation System is a Java-based backend application that handles customer demand for a small theater. The seating arrangement for each auditorium is stored in a file and represented in a linked list of linked lists. The program offers a user-friendly menu system for seat reservation and provides an option to reserve the best available seats if the desired seats are not available.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes and does not process actual payments or reservations.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Seating Arrangement**: Utilizes linked lists to dynamically update the seating arrangement based on file input.
- **Seat Reservation**: Allows users to reserve sequential seats based on their preference.
- **Best Available Seats**: Offers the best available seats that meet user criteria in the entire auditorium.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a report indicating how many seats were sold/unsold and how much money was earned.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Advanced Java Programming**: Showcases advanced programming concepts like linked lists, file I/O, exception handling, and object-oriented programming.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user data falls within the proper range and prevents users from reserving already reserved seats.
- **User Interface Design**: Presents a user-friendly menu system for seat reservation.

## Technical Details

The Advanced Theater Ticket Reservation System is developed using Java. It employs file I/O to read and write the seating arrangement from and to a file. The program validates user inputs and handles seat reservations based on user preferences.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts for personalized experiences.
- **Multiple Auditoriums**: Extend the system to handle multiple auditoriums.
- **Advanced Seat Selection**: Provide an option for users to select non-sequential seats or seats from different rows.
